ht://Dig contributed stuff.

This directory tree contains mostly perl programs that attempt to
do things with the generated databases.  Most of these were written
for a very specific purpose for the version of ht://Dig that was current
at the time of writing.  This means that some of these programs will
be severely broken!  Do not expect them to work; use them only as
examples of the types of things you can do with the ht://Dig databases.
