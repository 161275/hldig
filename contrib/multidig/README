This document is part of the "multidig script system" a system of
shell scripts and some modified conf files that makes dealing with
multiple databases easier for ht://Dig. It assumes that you know what
ht://Dig is. If you don't know, see the website at
<http://www.htdig.org/>

This README is organized a lot like a FAQ. Perhaps that's because I
expect anyone looking at these scripts to have a bunch of
questions. Hey, maybe I'm wrong. I'm always open to suggestions,
criticisms, corrections, etc. E-mail me at <ghutchis@wso.williams.edu>

--------------------------------

INTRODUCTION:

* Why write multidig?

  There are many reasons I started the multidig system. The biggest
were the complaints that ht://Dig didn't have much of an
administration interface. If you're looking for one, multidig isn't
it. Yet. The next biggest is that people wanted me to make dealing
with multiple databases easier. If you're looking for this, you're in
the right place.

* Why should I bother with multidig?

  If you already have a multiple-database setup and it's working
smoothly, you probably don't want to bother with multidig. It was
written the way *I* would organize a multiple-database setup. Not
surprisingly, this is probably not how you've done it, so it might be
more pain to convert to multidig than it's worth.
  If you're planning a multiple-database setup or you have one and
it's not working well or it's too big a pain for you, this will
help. It hides most of the pain and suffering behind some shell
scripts and generally automates life. :-)

--------------------------------

SETTING UP

* How do I install it?

  It's pretty easy to install. It requires bash, or at least a
Bourne-shell that supports the "source" builtin. Obviously, it also
requires an installation of ht://Dig. :-)
  Change any paths in the Makefile. Maybe someday I'll make a
configure script or something to streamline this. Suggestions welcome.
  Then do a "make install" to install the scripts in the right place
and the config files in the right place.

* OK, cool so what's this multidig.conf file?

  This is the central repository of shell variables used by the
scripts. You can change any of the settings once installed.

* How do I configure the multiple databases?

  This has been the biggest pain with ht://Dig's treatment of multiple
databases. You really need a config file for each database. So
multidig makes one when you run the new-db or new-collect
scripts. These scripts also make a new directory for all the database
files and URL or collection lists for the contents of the databases.
  Since version 3.1.0 and later of ht://Dig add an 'include' keyword
to config files, the database configs read the htdig.conf file (or
anything else if you edit them) and use those settings.

--------------------------------

COLLECTIONS

* What's a collection?

  Version 3.1.0 of ht://Dig added support for merging multiple
databases together. Technically, you merge one database into
another. Multidig makes this a bit easier. You set up a "collection"
of other databases and the multidig script will merge them all
together.

* Fantastic! How do I define a collection?

./new-collect <name>
./add-collect <name>
<insert dbs here>

 The add-collect script will go through the list of dbs and make sure
the multidig system actually knows about them. If not, it complains.
