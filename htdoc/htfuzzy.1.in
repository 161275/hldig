.SH NAME
htfuzzy \- creates indexes for different ``fuzzy'' search algorithms for
the ht:://Dig search engine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B htfuzzy
.I "[options] algorithm ..."
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I Htfuzzy
creates indexes for different ``fuzzy'' search algorithms.
These indexes can then be used by the
.I htsearch
program.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c \fIconfigfile\fR
Use the specified
.I configfile
instead of the default. 
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
Used once will provide progress feedback, used
more than once will overflow even the biggest buffers. :-) 
.SH "ALGORITHMS"
Indexes for the following search algorithms can currently be created: 
.TP
.B soundex 
Creates a slightly modified soundex key database. Differences
with the standard soundex algorithm are: Keys are 6 digits and the first
letter is also encoded. 
.TP
.B metaphone 
Creates a metaphone key database. This algorithm is more
specific to English, but will get fewer "weird" matches than the
soundex algorithm. 
.TP
.B endings 
Creates two databases which can be used to match common
word endings. The creation of these databases requires a list of
affix rules and a dictionary which uses those affix rules. The
format of the affix rules and dictionary files are the ones used
by the ispell program. Included with the distribution are the
affix rules for English and a fairly small English dictionary.
Other languages can be supported by getting the appropriate
affix rules and dictionaries. These are available for many
languages; check the ispell distribution for more details. 
.TP
.B synonyms 
Creates a database of synonyms for words. It reads a text
database of synonyms and creates a database that htsearch
can then use. Each line of the text database consists of words
where the first word will have the other words on that line as
synonyms. 
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.B @DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE@
The default configuration file.
