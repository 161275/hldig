	<p>
	  There are several programs in the ht://Dig package. 
	</p>
	<h3>

	<p>
	  Digging is the first step in creating a search database. This
	  system uses the word <em>digging</em> while other systems call
	  it <em>harvesting</em> or <i>gathering</i>. In the ht://Dig
	  system, the program <a href="htdig.html">htdig</a> performs
	  the information gathering stage. In this process, the program
	  will act as a regular web user, except that it will follow
	  <em>all</em> hyperlinks that it comes across. (Actually, it
	  will not follow all of them, just those that are within the
	  domain it needs to gather information on...)<br>
	   Each document it goes to is examined and all the unique
	  words in this document are extracted and stored.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The digging process will create at least two files. The first
	  one is the list of all the words and the second one is a
	  database of URLs and information about the URLs.
	</p>

	<h3>
	  <a href="htsearch.html" target="_top">htsearch</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
	  Searching is where the users actually get to use all the
	  information that was gathered during the dig and merge
	  stages. The <a href="htsearch.html" target="_top">
	  htsearch</a> program performs the actual searches. It
	  produces <code>HTML</code> output which will be seen by the
	  users.

	<p>
	  The ht://Dig system includes a handy reminder service which
	  allows HTML authors to add some ht://Dig specific meta
	  information in HTML documents. This meta information is
	  used to email authors after a specified date. Very useful
	  to maintain lists that contain those annoying 'new'
	  graphics with new items. (Hint: things really aren't all
	  that 'new' anymore after 6 months!)<br>
	</p>
	<hr noshade>
	<h3>
	<a href="htfuzzy.html">htfuzzy</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
	  To allow the searches to use "fuzzy" algorithms to match
	  words, the <a href="htfuzzy.html">htfuzzy</a> program can
	  create indexes for several different algorithms.
