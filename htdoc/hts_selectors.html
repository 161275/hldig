	<h2>
	  Input parameter select lists
	</h2>
	<p>
	  The primary interface to htsearch is through an HTML
	  <a href="hts_form.html">form</a>.
	  The input fields in this form can be defined as any type that
	  HTML allows, but some of these are best handled through HTML
	  <em>select</em> lists.
	</p>
	<h3>
	  <a name="predefined"></a>
	  Pre-defined template select lists
	</h3>
	<p>
	  In order to propagate these select lists to the search form
	  in the results template, so that the default <em>selected</em>
	  value will be the one the user last selected, htsearch defines
	  a few of these select lists as
	  <a href="hts_templates.html">template variables</a>.
	  These variables are:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		<strong>FORMAT</strong>, which selects the <b>format</b> input parameter
		for follow-up searches, with the current value being the
		default. The current value is taken from the <strong>format</strong>
		input parameter, if one was provided, or from the
		<a href="attrs.html#template_name">template_name</a>
		attribute otherwise, and this value will also be given in
		the <strong>SELECTED_FORMAT</strong> template variable.
		The various parameter values, and their corresponding
		labels for the select list, are taken from the
		<a href="attrs.html#template_map">template_map</a>
		attribute.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<strong>METHOD</strong>, which selects the <b>method</b> input parameter
		for follow-up searches, with the current value being the
		default. The current value is taken from the <strong>method</strong>
		input parameter, if one was provided, or from the
		<a href="attrs.html#match_method">match_method</a>
		attribute otherwise, and this value will also be given in
		the <strong>SELECTED_METHOD</strong> template variable.
		The various parameter values, and their corresponding
		labels for the select list, are taken from the
		<a href="attrs.html#method_names">method_names</a>
		attribute.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<strong>SORT</strong>, which selects the <b>sort</b> input parameter
		for follow-up searches, with the current value being the
		default. The current value is taken from the <strong>sort</strong>
		input parameter, if one was provided, or from the
		<a href="attrs.html#sort">sort</a>
		attribute otherwise, and this value will also be given in
		the <strong>SELECTED_SORT</strong> template variable.
		The various parameter values, and their corresponding
		labels for the select list, are taken from the
		<a href="attrs.html#sort_names">sort_names</a>
		attribute.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  In addition to these template variables, htsearch makes
	  use of a number of other input parameters, all of which
	  have corresponding template variables and configuration
	  attributes.  It's also possible, within htsearch, to make an
	  input parameter out of any <a href="attrs.html">configuration
	  attribute</a> that's not already automatically handled by an
	  input parameter. This is accomplished by means of the
	  <a href="attrs.html#allow_in_form">allow_in_form</a> attribute.
	  The attributes listed in the allow_in_form list will be settable
	  in the search form using input parameters of the same name,
	  and will be propagated to the follow-up search form in the
	  results template using template variables of the same name
	  in upper-case.
	</p>
	<h3>
	  <a name="custom"></a>
	  Custom template select lists
	</h3>
	<p>
	  This gives you a great deal of flexibility in configuring
	  htsearch, but all of these template variables still contain
	  only the parameter value, and not a select list to choose
	  the value. In order to use any input parameters as select
	  lists, other than the three pre-defined variables above, one
	  must either statically define a select list in the results
	  template follow-up form, just as in the initial search form
	  or instruct htsearch to build one as a template variable.
	  Statically defining new select lists is easier, as you have
	  to do it for the initial search form anyway, but this has the
	  drawback that the user's selection from the initial form does
	  not appear as the default selection in the follow-up form,
	  because the default is static.
	</p>
	<p>
	  To overcome this drawback, you must use the
	  <a href="attrs.html#build_select_lists">build_select_lists</a>
	  configuration attribute. Its usage is a bit complicated, but
	  it's extremely flexible, allowing you do define any htsearch
	  input parameter as a select list for use in templates, provided
	  you also define the corresponding name list attribute which
	  enumerates all the choices to put in the list. It can be used
	  for existing input parameters, as well as any you define using
	  the allow_in_form attribute.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The entries in this list each consist of an <em>octuple</em>, a
	  set of eight strings defining the variables and how they are to
	  be used to build a select list. The attribute can contain many
	  of these octuples. The strings in the string list are merely
	  taken eight at a time. For each octuple of strings specified in
	  build_select_lists, the elements have the following meaning:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
		the name of the template variable to be defined as a list
	  </li>
	  <li>
		the input parameter name that the select list will set
	  </li>
	  <li>
		the name of the user-defined attribute containing the
		<em>name list</em>, that is the list of values and labels
		for the select list items, much like the template_map,
		method_name and sort_name attributes
	  </li>
	  <li>
		the <em>tuple</em> size used in the name list above
	  </li>
	  <li>
		the index into a name list tuple for the value
	  </li>
	  <li>
		the index for the corresponding label to be displayed on
		the selector
	  </li>
	  <li>
		the configuration attribute where the default value for
		this input parameter is defined, which may or may not be
		the same name as the input parameter
	  </li>
	  <li>
		the default label, if not an empty string, which will be
		used as the label for an additional list item for the
		current input parameter value if it doesn't match any value
		in the given list
	  </li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	  The name list that you define will most commonly consist
	  of pairs of values, and therefore you'd use a tuple size of
	  2. The method_names and sort_names attributes are samples of
	  such name lists. You can give any name you'd like to the name
	  list attributes you define yourself, but you should try to
	  avoid using any of the names of <a href="attrs.html">existing
	  attributes</a>. The value and label for the pairs in lists you
	  define yourself can appear in either order, depending on the
	  index you specify for each. In the case where you'd want the
	  labels on the selector to be the same as the actual parameter
	  values used, which would make sense for lists of numbers,
	  you can use a tuple size of 1, and indexes of 1, to avoid
	  having to duplicate all the numbers in the list.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Any of the strings in an octuple may be quoted, and should be if
	  you want to include spaces or define an empty string.  If the
	  the default label, the eight element in an entry, is an empty
	  string, the select list will not have a <em>selected</em> item
	  if the current input parameter value doesn't match any value
	  in the name list. If a default label is given, an additional
	  list item will be added to the list using this label, if the
	  current input parameter value doesn't match.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Here is an example of its usage, which illustrates different
	  tuple sizes and orders:
	</p>
	<pre>
build_select_lists:     MATCH_LIST matchesperpage matches_per_page_list \
                                1 1 1 matches_per_page "Previous Amount" \
                RESTRICT_LIST restrict restrict_names 2 1 2 restrict "" \
                FORMAT_LIST format template_map 3 2 1 template_name ""

matches_per_page_list:  1 5 10 20 100 500

restrict_names: "http://www.myschool.edu/Admin/" "Admin Web Pages" \
                "http://www.myschool.edu/Faculty/" "Faculty Web Pages" \
                "http://www.myschool.edu/Student/" "Student Web Pages" \
                "" "Whole Web Site"
	</pre>
	<p>
	  The FORMAT_LIST example should give something equivalent to the FORMAT
	  template variable, which is already set by htsearch.  It is included as
	  an additional example of how to specify the tuple size and indices of
	  values and labels in a tuple.
	</p>
	<h3>
	  <a name="template_patterns"></a>
	  Combining the format select list with template_patterns
	</h3>
	<p>
	  The addition of the <a href="attrs.html#template_patterns">
	  template_patterns</a> attribute has added a new wrinkle to
	  the pre-defined select list for the <strong>format</strong> parameter.
	  If a document URL matches an entry in template_patterns, its
	  corresponding result template will override any template the
	  user selected with the format parameter. The problem stems
	  from the fact that the two were not originally intended to
	  be used together in the same htsearch configuration. When
	  configuring htsearch, you'd normally set it up to use one
	  mechanism or the other, but not a combination of the two.
	</p>
	<p>
	  However, the following example would allow user-selected
	  templates to work together with template_patterns:
	</p>
	<pre>
template_map:      Long long ${common_dir}/long.html \
                   Short short ${common_dir}/short.html
template_name:     long
template_patterns: .pdf ${common_dir}/${template_name}-pdffile.html \
                   .ps  ${common_dir}/${template_name}-psfile.html \
                   .doc ${common_dir}/${template_name}-docfile.html
	</pre>
	<p>
	  This works because the template_name attribute gets set
	  internally in htsearch, to the user-selected value of the
	  <strong>format</strong> input parameter, before the variable expansion
	  in template_patterns takes place. As long as you stick to
	  a template file naming convention that uses the internal
	  name element of template_map (second element in a triple) as
	  part of the file name, this should work like a charm. Your
	  common directory would have to contain the template files
	  long-pdffile.html, long-psfile.html, long-docfile.html,
	  short-pdffile.html, short-psfile.html, and short-docfile.html,
	  for the example above to work, in addition to the long.html
	  and short.html files, which will be used for URLs that don't
	  match any of the patterns. Of course, these patterns can be
	  any URL parts, and not just suffixes. Be sure to also change
	  the values for format in your initial search form, search.html,
	  to use your chosen internal names.
