	This guide is intended for those upgrading from 3.1.x or
	earlier versions to 3.2.x. The best advice is
	<em>don't</em>. That is, it is highly recommended that you
	install the 3.2 release in a separate directory tree and treat
	everything as if you were installing it for the first
	time. This is not just because this is a beta release. There
	are two main reasons for this:
	<ul>
	<li>The default directory structure of this release is
	different from previous releases, more in line with other UNIX
	programs.</li>
	<li>The databases are all in different formats. This version
	cannot read databases from previous versions since the new
	formats have significantly more information and this cannot be
	reconstructed from old databases. This goes for fuzzy
	databases as well.</li>
	</ul>
	Text files, such as config files, result templates, etc. are
	the same between releases, so you will probably wish to copy
	these to your new installation.</li>
	</p>

	<p>
	Additionally, you may find things a bit rough at first. We
	appreciate your comments and suggestions, especially in the
	form of performance comparisons with the 3.1.x
	releases. Additionally, there are several things planned for
	the final 3.2.0 release that have not been implemented yet:
	<ul>
	<li>Proximity (near) searching.</li>
	<li>Phrase searching method (in addition to and, or, and boolean).</li>
	<li>Field-based searching--restricting to a header, title, etc.</li>
	<li>Date-based searching--restricting to a range of dates.</li>
	<li>Implementation of a more accurate scoring system.</li>
	<li>Parallel indexing and searching.</li>
	<li>"Collections" of multiple databases.</li>
	<li>Support for nntp: and ftp: access</li>
	<li>Detection of loops and/or duplicate documents</li>
	<li>An accent-based fuzzy algorithm: match r&eacute;sum&eacute;
	with resume.</li>
	</ul>
	Please send comments, patches, etc. to the &lt;<a
	href="mailto:htdig3-dev@htdig.org">htdig3-dev@htdig.org</a>&gt;
	mailing list.
