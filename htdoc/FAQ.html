      <h2>Answers</h2>

      <h3>1. General</h3>
      1.1. <a name="q1.1">Can I search the internet with
      ht://Dig?</a><br>
      <p>No, ht://Dig is a system for indexing and searching a small
      set of sites or intranet. It is not meant to replace any of the
      many internet-wide search engines.</p>

      1.2. <a name="q1.2">Can I index the internet with
      ht://Dig?</a><br>
      <p>No, as above, ht://Dig is not meant as an
      internet-wide search engine. While there is
      <emph>theoretically</emph> nothing to stop you from indexing as
      much as you wish, practical considerations (e.g. time, disk
      space, memory, etc.) will limit this.</p>

      1.3. <a name="q1.3">What's the difference between htdig and ht://Dig?</a><br>
      <p>The complete ht://Dig consists of several programs, one of
      which is called "htdig." This program performs the "digging" or
      indexing of the web pages. Of course an index doesn't do you much good
      without a program to sort it, search through it, etc.</p>

      1.4. <a name="q1.4">I sent mail to Andrew but I never got a response!</a><br>
      <p>Andrew works on ht://Dig on the side. Since he is often busy
      with work and gets a lot of e-mail, it can take a while to respond.</p>

      1.5. <a name="q1.5">I sent a question to the mailing list but I
      never got a response!</a><br>
      <p>As with Andrew, the members of the mailing list have jobs
      too! Don't worry, someone will almost definitely get back to
      you.</p>

      1.6. <a name="q1.6">I have a great idea/patch for
      ht://Dig!</a><br>
      <p>Great! Development of ht://Dig continues through suggestions
      and improvements from users. If you have an idea (or even better,
      a patch), please send it to the ht://Dig mailing list so others
      can use it. For suggestions on how to submit patches, please check 
      the <a href="http://dev.htdig.org/patches.html">"Guidelines for
      Patch Submissions"</a></p>

      1.7. <a name="q1.7">Is ht://Dig Y2K compliant?</a><br>
      <p>
      ht://Dig should be y2k compliant since it never stores dates as 
      two-digit years. Under ht://Dig's copyright (GPL), there is no warranty 
      whatsoever. If you would like an iron-clad, legally-binding guarantee, 
      feel free to check the source code itself.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>2. Getting ht://Dig</h3>
      2.1. <a name="q2.1">What's the latest version of ht://Dig?</a><br>
      <p>The latest version is 3.1.0b1 as of this writing. Development
      is beginning on htdig4 as well as a few interim releases of
      htdig3.</p>

      2.2. <a name="q2.2">Are there binary distributions of
      ht://Dig?</a><br>
      <p>Not at the moment. As a test, the release of ht://Dig 3.0.8b2
      saw a pre-compiled SPARC/Solaris package in addition to the
      standard source release. Binary distributions are on the TODO list.</p>

      2.3. <a name="q2.3">Are there mirror sites for ht://Dig?</a><br>
      <p>Currently two sites exist for ht://Dig, <a
      href="http://www.htdig.org/">www.htdig.org</a> and <a
      href="http://htdig.sdsu.edu">htdig.sdsu.edu</a>. The www.htdig.org
      site contains the most up-to-date information and
      releases. Currently no other mirrors exist.</p>

      2.4. <a name="q2.4">Is ht://Dig available by ftp?</a><br>
      <p>Not at the moment.</p>

      2.5. <a name="q2.5">Are patches around to upgrade between
      versions?</a><br>
      <p>Most versions are also distributed as a patch to the previous
      version's source code. The most recent exception to this was
      version 3.1.0b1. Since this version switched from the GDBM
      database to DB2, the new database package needed to be shipped
      with the distribution. This would make the patch almost as large
      as the regular distribution.</p>
      <p>

      <h3>3. Compiling</h3>
      3.1. <a name="q3.1">When I compile ht://Dig I get an error about libht.a</a><br>
      <p>This usually indicates that either libg++ is not installed or
      is installed incorrectly. To get libg++ or any other GNU too,
      check <a
      href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/</a></p>

      3.2. <a name="q3.2">I get an error about -lg</a><br>
      <p>This is due to a bug in the Makefile.config.in of version
      3.1.0b1. Remove all flags "-ggdb" in Makefile.config.in. Then
      type "./config.status" to rebuild the Makefiles and recompile.</p>
      <p>

      <h3>4. Configuration</h3>
      4.1. <a name="q4.1">How come I can't index my site?</a><br>
      4.2. <a name="q4.2">How can I change the output format of htsearch?</a><br>
<p>Answer contributed by: Malka Cymbalista <vumalki@ultra1.weizmann.ac.il></p>

<p>You can change the output format of htsearch by creating different
header, footer and result files that specify how you want the output
to look. You then create a configuration file that specifies which
files to use. In the html document that links to the search, you
specify which configuration file to use.</p>

<p>So the configuration file would have the lines:<br>
search_results_header: ${common_dir}/ccheader.html<br>
search_results_footer: ${common_dir}/ccfooter.html<br>
template_map:   Long long builtin-long \<br>
                Short short builtin-short \<br>
                Default default ${common_dir}/ccresult.html<br>
template_name:  Default<br>
You would also put into the configuration file any other lines from the
default configuration file that apply to htsearch.</p>

<p>The files ${common_dir}/ccheader.html and
${common_dir}/ccfooter.html and ${common_dir}/ccresult.html would be
tailored to give the output in the desired format.</p>

<p>Assuming your configuration file is called cc.conf, the html file that
links to the search has to set the config parameter equal to cc. The
following line would do it:<br>
<pre>&lt;input type=hidden name=config value="cc"&gt;</pre></p>

      4.3. <a name="q4.3">How do I index pages that start with '~'?</a><br>
      <p>
      ht://Dig should index pages starting with '~' as if it was another 
      web browser. If you are having problems with this, check your server 
      log files to see what file the server is attempting to return.
      </p>
      
      4.4. <a name="q4.4">Can I use multiple databases?</a><br>
      <p>Yes, though you may find it easier to have one larger
      database and use restrict or exclude fields on searches. To use
      multiple databases, you will need a config file for each
      database. Then each file will set the "database_base" option to
      change the name of the databases.</p>

      4.5. <a name="q4.5">OK, I can use multiple databases. Can I
      merge them into one?</a><br>
      <p>Not at the moment. This is on the TODO list.</a>
      <p>

      <h3>6. Troubleshooting</h3>
      6.1. <a name="q6.1">I can't seem to index more than X documents
      in a directory.</a><br>
      <p>This usually has to do with the default document size
      limit. If you set "max_doc_size" in your config file to
      something enough to read in the directory index (try 100000 for
      100K) this should fix this problem. Of course this will require
      more memory to read the larger file.</p>

      6.2. <a name="q6.2">I can't index PDF files.</a><br>
      <p>As above, this usually has to do with the default document
      size. What happens is ht://Dig will read in part of a PDF file
      and try to index it. This usually fails. Try setting
      "max_doc_size" in your config file to a larger value than your
      largest PDF file.</p>

      6.3. <a name="q6.3">When I run "rundig," I get a message about
      "DATABASE_DIR" not being found.</a><br>
      <p>This is due to a bug in the Makefile.in file in version
      3.1.0b1. The easiest fix is to edit the rundig file and change
      the line "TMPDIR=@DATABASE_DIR@" to set TMPDIR to a directory
      with a large amount of temporary disk space for htmerge.</p>

      6.4. <a name="q6.4">When I run htmerge, it stops with an "out
      of diskspace" message.</a><br>
      <p>This means that htmerge has run out of temporary disk space
      for sorting. Either in your "rundig" script (if you run htmerge
      through that) or before you run htmerge, set the variable TMPDIR
      to a temp directory with lots of space.</p>

      6.5. <a name="q6.5">I have problems running rundig from cron
      under Linux.</a><br>
      <p>This problem seems to be fixed by upgrading to a recent
      version of cron or vixie-cron. If this doesn't completely fix
      the problem, edit the first line of rundig to "#!/bin/csh" which
      will run the script through the csh shell.</p>

      6.6. <a name="q6.6">When I run htmerge, it stops with an
      "Unexpected file type" message.</a><br>
      <p>Often this is because the databases are corrupt. Try removing
      them and rebuilding. If this doesn't work, some have found that
      the solution for question <a href="#q3.2">3.2</a> works for this
      as well.</p>
