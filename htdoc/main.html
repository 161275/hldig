	<h2>
	  Introduction
	</h2>
	<p>
	  The ht://Dig system is a complete world wide web indexing and
	  searching system for a small domain or intranet. This system
	  is <strong>not</strong> meant to replace the need for
	  powerful internet-wide search systems like Lycos, Infoseek,
	  Webcrawler and AltaVista. Instead it is meant to cover the
	  search needs for a single company, campus, or even a
	  particular sub section of a web site.<br>
	   As opposed to some WAIS-based or web-server based search
	  engines, ht://Dig can span several web servers at a site. The
	  type of these different web servers doesn't matter as long as
	  they understand the HTTP 1.0 protocol.
	</p>
	<p>
	  ht://Dig was developed at <a href="http://www.sdsu.edu/">San
	  Diego State University</a> as a way to search the various web
	  servers on the campus network. Here are some examples of the
	  application of ht://Dig on the SDSU network:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		<a href="http://www.sdsu.edu/">A "Quick" search on the main
		campus home page</a>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<a href="http://www.sdsu.edu/search/">A more comprehensive
		interface to the same</a>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<a href="http://libweb.sdsu.edu/catalog/Search.html">A
		search of the online SDSU General Catalog</a>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<a href="http://www.sdsu.edu/doc/">Searches through various
		online documentation</a>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<form action="http://www.htdig.org/cgi-bin/htsearch" method="post">
	  <p>
		You can search this documentation as well:<br>
		<input type="hidden" name="config" value="htdig">
		<input type="hidden" name="method" value="and">
		<input type="text" name="words" size="40">
		<input type="submit" value="Search">
	  </p>
	</form>
	<p>
	  Many different types of searches can be set up using only a
	  single search database. For example, the online documentation
	  search above uses the same database as the campus main
	  search. The difference between the searches is that the
	  documentation search will only show results related to the
	  online documentation.

		<strong><img src="bdot.gif" width=9 height=9 alt="*"> Fuzzy searching</strong>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		Searches can be performed using various configurable
		algorithms. Currently the following algorithms are
		supported (in any combination):
		<ul>
		  <li>
			exact
		  </li>
		  <li>
			soundex
		  </li>
		  <li>

		searched. Searching of other file types will be
		supported in future versions.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		<strong><img src="bdot.gif" width=9 height=9 alt="*"> Keywords can be added to HTML
		documents</strong>
	   </dt>
	  <dd>
		Any number of keywords can be added to HTML documents
		which will not show up when the document is viewed.
		This is used to make a document more like to be found
		and also to make it appear higher in the list of
		matches.
	  </dd>

		<strong><img src="bdot.gif" width=9 height=9 alt="*"> Email notification of expired
		documents</strong>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		Special meta information can be added to HTML documents
		which can be used to notify the maintainer of those
		documents at a certain time. It is handy to get
		reminded when to remove the "New" images from a certain
		page, for example.

		<strong><img src="bdot.gif" width=9 height=9 alt="*"> A Protected server can be indexed</strong>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>

		protected by a username and password.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		<strong><img src="bdot.gif" width=9 height=9 alt="*"> Searches on subsections of the
		database</strong>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		It is easy to set up a search which only returns
		documents whose URL matches a certain pattern. This
		becomes very useful for people who want to make their
		own data searchable without having to use a separate
		search engine or database.

	  <dt>
		<strong><img src="bdot.gif" width=9 height=9 alt="*"> Full source code included</strong>
	  </dt>

		<strong><img src="bdot.gif" width=9 height=9 alt="*"> The depth of the search can be limited</strong>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		Instead of limiting the search to a set of machines, it
		can also be restricted to documents that are a certain
		number of "mouse-clicks" away from the start document.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		<strong><img src="bdot.gif" width=9 height=9 alt="*"> Full support for the ISO-Latin-1 character
