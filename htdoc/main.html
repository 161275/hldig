	<h2>
	  Introduction
	</h2>
	<p>
	  The ht://Dig system is a complete world wide web indexing and
	  searching system for a small domain or intranet. This system
	  is <strong>not</strong> meant to replace the need for
	  powerful internet-wide search systems like Lycos, Infoseek,
	  Webcrawler and AltaVista. Instead it is meant to cover the
	  search needs for a single company, campus, or even a
	  particular sub section of a web site.<br>
	   As opposed to some WAIS-based or web-server based search
	  engines, ht://Dig can span several web servers at a site. The
	  type of these different web servers doesn't matter as long as
	  they understand the HTTP 1.0 protocol.
	</p>
	<p>
	  ht://Dig was developed at <a href="http://www.sdsu.edu/">San
	  Diego State University</a> as a way to search the various web
	  servers on the campus network. Here are some examples of the
	  application of ht://Dig on the SDSU network:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		<a href="http://www.sdsu.edu/">A "Quick" search on the main
		campus home page</a>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<a href="http://www.sdsu.edu/search/">A more comprehensive
		interface to the same</a>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<a href="http://libweb.sdsu.edu/catalog/Search.html">A
		search of the online SDSU General Catalog</a>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<a href="http://www.sdsu.edu/doc/">Searches through various
		online documentation</a>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<form action="http://www.htdig.org/cgi-bin/htsearch" method="post">
	  <p>
		You can search this documentation as well:<br>
		<input type="hidden" name="config" value="htdig">
		<input type="hidden" name="method" value="and">
		<input type="text" name="words" size="40">
		<input type="submit" value="Search">
	  </p>
	</form>
	<p>
	  Many different types of searches can be set up using only a
	  single search database. For example, the online documentation
	  search above uses the same database as the campus main
	  search. The difference between the searches is that the
	  documentation search will only show results related to the
	  online documentation.
