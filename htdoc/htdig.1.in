.SH NAME
htdig \- retrieve HTML documents for ht://Dig search engine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B htdig
.I "[options]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Htdig retrieves HTML documents using the HTTP protocol and
gathers information from these documents which can later be
used to search these documents. This program can be referred to
as the search robot. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
Use alternate work files. Tells htdig to append
.I .work
to database files, causing a second copy of the database to be
built. This allows the original files to be used by htsearch
during the indexing run. 
.TP
.B \-c \fIconfigfile\fR
Use the specified
.I configfile
instead of the default. 
.TP
.B \-h \fImaxhops\fR
Restrict the dig to documents that are at most
.I maxhops
links away from the starting document. This only works if option \fI\-i\fR
is also given. 
.TP
.B \-i
Initial. Do not use any old databases. This is accomplished by
first erasing the databases. 
.TP
.B \-s
Print statistics about the dig after completion. 
.TP
.B \-t
Create an ASCII version of the document database. This
database is easy to parse with other programs so that
information can be extracted from it for purposes other
than searching. One could gather some interesting statistics
from this database. 
.TP
.B \-u
.I username:password 
Tells htdig to send the supplied username and password with
each HTTP request. The credentials will be encoded using the
'Basic' authentication scheme. There HAS to be a colon (:)
between the username and password. 
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode. This increases the verbosity of the program.
Using more than 2 is probably only useful for debugging
purposes. The default verbose mode (using only one \fI\-v\fR) gives
a nice progress report while digging. 
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.B @DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE@
The default configuration file.
