[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andy5995/hldig.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andy5995/hldig)

hl://Dig is a fork of [ht://Dig](https://sourceforge.net/projects/htdig/),
a world-wide-web search system for an intranet or small internet.

We are in the process of updating the
[web site](https://andy5995.github.io/hldig/)
and documentation.

Recently, I wrote a quick-guide to [building and testing hl://Dig](TESTING.md),
but it doesn't cover all the programs in the hl://Dig package.

I've [opened a ticket](https://github.com/andy5995/hldig/issues/50)
to discuss how to proceed with documentation and what type of web site to put
in place.
