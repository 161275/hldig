[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andy5995/htdig.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andy5995/htdig)

htdig is a world-wide-web search system for an intranet or small internet.

[htdig project page](https://github.com/andy5995/htdig/)

This is a continuation of htdig, not maintained by the original developers.

The original site is currently expired, but a version of it can be found at

[htdig](https://andy5995.github.io/htdig/)

Some of the documentation from that site still applies to htdig, but many
links on that site are dead or no longer relevant.

Recently, I wrote a quick-guide to [building and testing htdig](TESTING.md),
but it doesn't cover all the programs in the htdig package.

I've [opened a ticket](https://github.com/andy5995/htdig/issues/50)
to discuss how to proceed with documentation and what type of web site to put
in place.

## Try it out
At the following link you can try a search. The form calls `htsearch` which searches
a database created by `htdig` crawling [http://www.read.gov/aesop/](http://www.read.gov/aesop/)
(try using keywords such as "frogs", "fox", or "Hercules").<br />
