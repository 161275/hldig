.SH NAME
hlmerge \- create document index and word database for the hl://Dig
search engine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hlmerge
.I "[options]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I hlmerge
is used to create a document index and word database
from the files that were created by \fIhldig\fR. These databases are
then used by
.I hlsearch
to perform the actual searched. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
Use alternate work files. Tells hldig to append
.I .work
to database files, causing a second copy of the database to be
built. This allows the original files to be used by hlsearch
during the indexing run. 
.TP
.B \-c \fIconfigfile\fR
Use the specified
.I configfile
instead of the default. 
.TP
.B \-d
Prevent the document index from being created. 
.TP
.B \-s
Print statistics about the document and word databases
after hlmerge has finished. 
.TP
.B \-v
Run in verbose mode. This will provide some hints as to the
progress of the merge. This can be useful when running
hlmerge interactively since some parts (especially the word
database creation) can take a very long time. 
.TP
.B \-w
Prevent the word database from being created. 
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B TMPDIR
In addition to the command line options, the environment
variable
.I TMPDIR
will be used to designate the directory where
intermediate files are stored during the sorting process. 
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.B @DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE@
The default configuration file.
