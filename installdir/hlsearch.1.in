.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hlsearch
.I "[options]" "[query_string]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I hlsearch
is used to search in de databases created by \fIhldig\fR for content.
is the actual search engine of the \fIhldig\fR search system. It is a CGI
program that is expected to be invoked by an HTML form. It will accept both the
GET and POST methods of passing data to the CGI program. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B query_string
A CGI-style query string can be given as a single
argument, and is only used if the REQUEST_METHOD environment
variable is not set.  If no query_string is given, and
REQUEST_METHOD is not set, hlsearch will prompt for the query.
.TP
.B \-c \fIconfigfile\fR
Use the specified
.I configfile
instead of the default (for security reasons this option is only
available when hlsearch is used on the commandline).
.TP
.B \-v \-d
Run in verbose mode.  This increases the verbosity of the
