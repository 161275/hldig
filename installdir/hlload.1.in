.SH NAME
hlload \- reads in an ASCII-text version of the document database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hlload
.I "[options]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
hlload  reads in an ASCII-text version of the document database in the same form as
the  -t  option  of  hldig  and  hldump. Note that this will overwrite data in your
databases, so this should be used with great care.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
Use alternate work files. Tells hlload to append 
.I .work
to database files, allowing it to
operate on a second set of databases.
.TP
.B \-c \fIconfigfile\fR
Use the specified
.I configfile
instead of the default.
.TP
.B \-i
Initial.  Do  not use any old databases. This is accomplished by first erasing
the databases.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode. This doesn't have much effect.
.SH File Formats

.B Word Database
While hldump and hlload don't deal with the word database
directly, it's worth mentioning it here because you need to
deal with it when copying the ASCII databases from one system
to another. The initial word database produced by hldig is
already in ASCII format, and a binary version of it is
produced by hlmerge, for use by hlsearch. So, when you copy
over the ASCII version of the document database produced by
hldump, you need to copy over the wordlist as well, then
run hlload to make the binary document database on the target
system, followed by running hlmerge to make the word index.
.TP
Each line in the word list file starts with the word
followed by a list of
