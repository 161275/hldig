<h3>Berkeley DB Programmer's Reference: Programmer Notes</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Error returns to applications</h1>
<p>
Except for the historic <a href="../../api_c/historic/dbm.html">dbm</a>, <a href="../../api_c/historic/dbm.html">ndbm</a> and <a href="../../api_c/historic/hsearch.html">hsearch</a>
interfaces, Berkeley DB does not use the global variable <b>errno</b> to
return error values.
The return values for all Berkeley DB functions can be grouped into three
categories:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>0<dd>A return value of 0 indicates that the operation was successful.
<p><dt>> 0<dd>A return value that is greater than 0 indicates that there was a system
error.
The <b>errno</b> value returned by the system is returned by the function,
e.g., when a Berkeley DB function is unable to allocate memory, the return value
from the function will be ENOMEM.
<p><dt>< 0<dd>A return value that is less than 0 indicates a condition that was not
a system failure,
but was not an unqualified success, either.
For example,
a routine to retrieve a key/data pair from the database may return
DB_NOTFOUND when the key/data pair does not appear in the database,
as opposed to the value of 0, which would be returned if the key/data
pair were found in the database.
All such special values returned by Berkeley DB functions are less than 0 in
order to avoid conflict with possible values of
<b>errno</b>.
</dl>
<p>
There are two special return values that are somewhat similar in meaning,
are returned in similar situations,
and therefore might be confused: DB_NOTFOUND and DB_KEYEMPTY.
<p>
The DB_NOTFOUND error return indicates that the requested key/data pair did
not exist in the database or that start- or end-of-file has been reached.
<p>
The DB_KEYEMPTY error return indicates that the requested key/data pair
logically exists but was never explicitly created by the application (the
recno access method will automatically create key/data pairs under some
circumstances, see
<a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a>
for more information),
or that the requested key/data pair was deleted and is currently in a deleted
state.
