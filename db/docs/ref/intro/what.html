<h3>Berkeley DB Programmer's Reference: Introduction</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>What is Berkeley DB?</h1>
<p>
The Berkeley DB library is a set of subsystems that provide a multi-lingual,
modular programming interface to keyed databases.
The library includes support for various indexed access methods
(currently B+tree, Extended Linear Hashing, and Fixed and Variable-length
records), and in the scope of those access methods, transactions and full
recoverability, locking, logging and file page caching.
<p>
Many of the subsystems (e.g., the shared memory buffer pool subsystem) are
useful independent of the other Berkeley DB subsystems.  However, some subsystems
are explicitly based on other subsystems (e.g., using the
transaction subsystem also requires using the logging subsystem).
<p>
Berkeley DB supports C, C++, Java and Perl APIs.
<p>
The Berkeley DB library does not provide user interfaces, data entry GUI's, SQL
support or any of the other standard user-level database interfaces.
What it does provide are the programmatic building blocks that allow you
to easily embed database-style functionality and support into other objects
or interfaces.
