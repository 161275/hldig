<h3>Berkeley DB Programmer's Reference: Transaction Subsystem</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Transaction limits</h1>
<p>
The transaction ID space in Berkeley DB is 2^31, or 2 billion entries.
It is possible that some environments may need to be aware of this
limitation.
Consider an application performing 600 transactions a second for 15
hours a day.
The transaction ID space will run out in roughly 66 days:
<p><ul><pre>2^31 / (600 * 15 * 60 * 60) = 66</pre></ul><p>
<p>
Doing only 100 transactions a second exhausts the transaction ID space
in roughly one year.
<p>
The transaction ID space is reset each time recovery is run.
If you reach the end of your transaction ID space,
shut down your applications and restart them after running recovery (see
Db_recover for more information).
The most recently allocated transaction ID is the <b>st_last_txnid</b>
value in the transaction statistics information, and is displayed by the
<a href="../../utility/db_stat.html">db_stat</a> utility.
