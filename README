*** ht://Dig 4.0 interim README information ***

We are in the process of upgrading ht://Dig to use a different backend
database than what is currently used. This will cause enough changes to
warrant a version change up to 4.0. Along with redesigning the backend
database, htsearch is being looked at to possibly be broken into two
separate modules, htsearch and htdisplay (display to be finished some
time afterwards).
