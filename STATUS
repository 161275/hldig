STATUS of ht://Dig branch 3-2-x

RELEASES:
   3.2.0b2: Release date (31 Mar 2000), Unfrozen
   3.2.0b1: Released: 4 Feb 2000.

SHOWSTOPPERS:

KNOWN BUGS:
* htdig/Image.cc doesn't use Transport classes.
* URL.cc tries to parse malformed URLs (which causes further problems)
   (It should probably just set everything to empty) This relates to 
   PR#348.
* Not all htsearch input parameters are handled properly: PR#648.
* If exact isn't specified in the search_algorithms, $(WORDS) is not set 
   correctly: PR#650. (The documentation for 3.2.0b1 is updated, but can
   we fix this?)
* Running on BSDI and similar systems causes coredumps because the regex
   code is incompatible. We need some sort of configure test for this.
* SGML encoding/decoding does not work with numeric forms, e.g. &#34; -> quote.
* Modified database can cause problems with systems using the Berkeley db for 
   other tasks (e.g. networking)
* Prefix matching current does not work--it attempts to search for the
   same word 
* Transport code and Connection code can cause segfaults when using
   ExternalProtocol scripts.

PENDING FEATURES:
* htload program.
* Hans-Peter's url-seed-score patch.
* Forward-Porting of NNTP code.
* Additional support for Win32.
* Make URL and Server blocks match documentation--i.e. change config
   lookups in htdig to work as suggested.

TESTING:
* ExternalTransport with non 'http' URLs.
* URL parser
* htfuzzy tests
* New config parser
* htmerge -m

DOCUMENTATION:
* Update cf_* pages to mention new config parser (i.e. URL-dependent config)
* Add thorough documentation on htsearch restrict/exclude behavior
  (including | and regex).
* require.html is not updated to list new features and disk space
  requirements of 3.2.x (e.g. phrase searching, regex matching,
  external parsers and transport methods, database compression.)
* TODO.html has not been updated for current TODO list and completions.

OTHER ISSUES:
* Can htsearch actually search while an index is being created?
* Can we reproduce the DB2 errors that sometimes cropped up in 3.1.x?
   (e.g. PR#473, PR#476)
* Error messages should be more informative if no URLs are indexed by htdig
   PR#672. In short, programs should do a little more checking.
