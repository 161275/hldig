STATUS of ht://Dig main trunk


SHOWSTOPPERS:
N/A: See htdig-3-2-x for current release branch

KNOWN BUGS:
* htdig/Image.cc doesn't use Transport classes.
* URL.cc tries to parse malformed URLs (which causes further problems)
   (It should probably just set everything to empty) This relates to 
   PR#348.
* Not all htsearch input parameters are handled properly: PR#648.
* If exact isn't specified in the search_algorithms, $(WORDS) is not set 
   correctly: PR#650. (The documentation for 3.2.0b1 is updated, but should
   we fix this?)

PENDING FEATURES:


TESTING:
* ExternalTransport with non 'http' URLs.
* URL parser
* htfuzzy tests
* New config parser
* Reports of problems with long timeouts (e.g PR#350)
* htmerge -m

DOCUMENTATION:
* Update cf_* pages to mention new config parser (i.e. URL-dependent config)
* Redesign based on 'categories'

OTHER ISSUES:
* Can htsearch actually search while an index is being created?
* Can we reproduce the DB2 errors that sometimes cropped up in 3.1.x?
   (e.g. PR#473, PR#476)
* Is the HTML output of htsearch HTML 4.0 strictly compliant?
* Do IP addresses for start_urls cause problems?: PR#634.
* Does Document::Retrieve or Transport close the connection properly?
  (it didn't in 3.1.x): PR#670.
* Error messages should be more informative if no URLs are indexed by htdig 
  or htmerge. PR#672.
* Should the various translate_* attributes be retired?
* Should we generate documentation for attributes that have been removed?
  (e.g. word_list, modification_time_is_now, etc.)
