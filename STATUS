STATUS of ht://Dig branch 3-2-x

RELEASES:
   3.2.0b1: Tentative Release: 2 Feb 2000, Hard Feature Freeze


SHOWSTOPPERS:
* (none at the moment)

KNOWN BUGS:
* htdig/Image.cc doesn't use Transport classes.
* URL.cc tries to parse malformed URLs (which causes further problems)
   (It should probably just set everything to empty) This relates to 
   PR#348.
* Server.cc does not use authentication when retrieving robots.txt: PR#490.
* Parsing of <meta> description tags and <img> alt text does not decode SGML 
   entities properly: PR#614.
* Not all htsearch input parameters are handled properly: PR#648.
* If exact isn't specified in the search_algorithms, $(WORDS) is not set 
   correctly: PR#650.
* htfuzzy endings: use of unlink fails if TMPDIR is not on the same 
   volume.

PENDING FEATURES:
* (Is there anything approved and not in the current CVS tree?)

TESTING:
* ExternalTransport with non 'http' URLs.
* URL parser
* htfuzzy tests
* New config parser
* Reports of problems with long timeouts (e.g PR#350)

DOCUMENTATION:
* Update cf_* pages to mention regex, new config parser (i.e. URL-dependent config)
* Update to mention phrase searching, regex fuzzy

OTHER ISSUES:
* Can htsearch actually search while an index is being created?
* Can we reproduce the DB2 errors that sometimes cropped up in 3.1.x?
   (e.g. PR#473, PR#476)
* Is the HTML output of htsearch HTML 4.0 strictly compliant?
* Do IP addresses for start_urls cause problems?: PR#634.
* Does Document::Retrieve or Transport close the connection properly?
  (it didn't in 3.1.x): PR#670.
* Error messages should be more informative if no URLs are indexed by htdig 
  or htmerge. PR#672.
* Reported problem where -h is ignored if modification_time_is_now set to 
  false. (Should mod_time_is_now just be true and removed as an attribute?)
* Are there timing/race conditions with the htnet Connection code?
* Retriever::Start() now manages persistent connections: but no priority
  queue for picking a server (depending on the delay, hopcount, and use
  of persistent connections) has been issued.
