STATUS of ht://Dig branch 3-2-x

RELEASES:
   3.2.0b1: Unscheduled, Feature-Freeze


SHOWSTOPPERS:
* htfuzzy will not generate a synonym fuzzy: 
   <http://www.htdig.org/htdig3-dev/1999/11/0097.html>
* Retriever/Server classes still need a cleanup.
   (Geoff: Server is finished, Retriever still needs work.)
* Changes in 3-1-x tree must be merged into current tree.
* HtHTTP does not properly use proxies.

KNOWN BUGS:
* htdig/Image.cc doesn't use Transport classes.
* URL.cc tries to parse malformed URLs (which causes further problems)
   (It should probably just set everything to empty) This relates to 
   PR#348.
* Server.cc does not use authentication when retrieving robots.txt: PR#490.
* Parsing of <meta> description tags and <img> alt text does not decode SGML 
   entities properly: PR#614.
* Not all htsearch input parameters are handled properly: PR#648.
* If exact isn't specified in the search_algorithms, $(WORDS) is not set 
   correctly: PR#650.
* htfuzzy endings: use of unlink fails if TMPDIR is not on the same 
  volume.

PENDING FEATURES:
* Vadim's config parser: in place, but currently only set for one attribute.
* Marcel's 8x compression: not yet ready.
	Vote: 
* Autoconf test for locale from Torsten: See PR#356

TESTING:
* ExternalTransport with non 'http' URLs.
* URL parser
* htfuzzy tests
* New config parser
* Reports of problems with long timeouts (e.g PR#350)

DOCUMENTATION:
* Update cf_* pages to mention regex, new parser
* Update to mention phrase searching, regex fuzzy

OTHER ISSUES:
* Can htsearch actually search while an index is being created?
* Can we reproduce the DB2 errors that sometimes cropped up in 3.1.x?
   (e.g. PR#473, PR#476)
* Is the HTML output of htsearch HTML 4.0 strictly compliant?
* Does configure test for <alloca.h>?: PR#545.
* Do IP addresses for start_urls cause problems?: PR#634.
* Does Document::Retrieve or Transport close the connection properly?
  (it didn't in 3.1.x): PR#670.
* Error messages should be more informative if no URLs are indexed by htdig 
  or htmerge. PR#672.
