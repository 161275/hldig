STATUS of ht://Dig branch 3-2-x

RELEASES:
   3.2.0b3: Release date unscheduled: Unfrozen Tree.
   3.2.0b2: Released:  11 Apr 2000.
   3.2.0b1: Released: 4 Feb 2000.

SHOWSTOPPERS:
* Geoff's copy on LinuxPPC is broken after Loic's mifluz merge. Still unkown cause.

KNOWN BUGS:
* URL.cc tries to parse malformed URLs (which causes further problems)
   (It should probably just set everything to empty) This relates to 
   PR#348.
* Not all htsearch input parameters are handled properly: PR#648.
* If exact isn't specified in the search_algorithms, $(WORDS) is not set 
   correctly: PR#650. (The documentation for 3.2.0b1 is updated, but can
   we fix this?)
* Odd behavior with $(MODIFIED) and scores not working with
   wordlist_compress set but work fine without wordlist_compress.
* Modified database can cause problems with systems using the Berkeley db for 
   other tasks (e.g. networking)

PENDING FEATURES:
* Forward-Porting of NNTP code.
* Additional support for Win32.
* Make URL and Server blocks match documentation--i.e. change config
   lookups in htdig to work as suggested.
* Field-restricted searching
* Date-restricted searching
* Return all results
* Duplicate document detection while indexing
* Method "exact" for phrase-searching on the entire query

TESTING:
* httools programs: 
  (htload a test file, check a few characteristics, htdump and compare)
* Turn on URL parser test as part of test suite.
* htsearch phrase support tests
* hopcount testing: are the pages actually indexed in the right order?

DOCUMENTATION:
* Update cf_* pages to mention new config parser (i.e. URL-dependent config)
* Add thorough documentation on htsearch restrict/exclude behavior
   (including | and regex).
* Split attrs.html into categories for faster loading.
* require.html is not updated to list new features and disk space
   requirements of 3.2.x (e.g. phrase searching, regex matching,
   external parsers and transport methods, database compression.)
* TODO.html has not been updated for current TODO list and completions.

OTHER ISSUES:
* Can htsearch actually search while an index is being created?
* Error messages should be more informative if no URLs are indexed by htdig
   PR#672. In short, programs should do a little more checking.
* Should htmerge only merge databases and become part of the httools
   directory? (The clean-up duties have now been implemented into htpurge.)
