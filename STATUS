STATUS of ht://Dig branch 3-2-x

RELEASES:
   3.2.0b2: Release date X Apr 2000.
   3.2.0b1: Released: 4 Feb 2000.

SHOWSTOPPERS:
* build_select_lists parses incorrectly.

KNOWN BUGS:
* URL.cc tries to parse malformed URLs (which causes further problems)
   (It should probably just set everything to empty) This relates to 
   PR#348.
* Not all htsearch input parameters are handled properly: PR#648.
* If exact isn't specified in the search_algorithms, $(WORDS) is not set 
   correctly: PR#650. (The documentation for 3.2.0b1 is updated, but can
   we fix this?)
* Modified database can cause problems with systems using the Berkeley db for 
   other tasks (e.g. networking)

PENDING FEATURES:
* Forward-Porting of NNTP code.
* Additional support for Win32.
* Make URL and Server blocks match documentation--i.e. change config
   lookups in htdig to work as suggested.
* Field-restricted searching
* Date-restricted searching
* Return all results
* Update db and htdb code to synch with mifluz-0.14 (will fix last item above)
* Duplicate document detection while indexing

TESTING:
* ExternalTransport with non 'http' URLs.
* URL parser
* htfuzzy tests
* New config parser
* htmerge -m

DOCUMENTATION:
* Update cf_* pages to mention new config parser (i.e. URL-dependent config)
* Add thorough documentation on htsearch restrict/exclude behavior
   (including | and regex).
* require.html is not updated to list new features and disk space
   requirements of 3.2.x (e.g. phrase searching, regex matching,
   external parsers and transport methods, database compression.)
* TODO.html has not been updated for current TODO list and completions.

OTHER ISSUES:
* Can htsearch actually search while an index is being created?
* Error messages should be more informative if no URLs are indexed by htdig
   PR#672. In short, programs should do a little more checking.
